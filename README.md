# FriendFinder- Node and Express Servers

## Overview
This project is a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site will take in results from a users' 10 question survey. The user responds to questions with values from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). When the survey is submitted, a Friends show character closest to the current user's responses is found and returned. The app will then display the name and picture of the Friends character with the best overall match.
